# Rule Of Thumb - Diego Pulido

### General

Welcome to my version of the **Rule of Thumb** website.
*This project was developed using Vanilla JS.*

After consuming the data contained into *assets/data.json*, we store our objects into LocalStorage, in order to be able to interact with it through our voting system.

Whenever a user clicks on the *Vote Now* button after selecting an option, we update our locally saved data with the new vote entered. This data persists in our browser as long as the user preserves the browser-saved variables.

### Installation

1. Download .zip, or clone repository through this URL: https://github.com/diegopulido2d/ruleofthumb.git
2. Open the folder in your IDE and run the project locally
3. If you are using VisualStudio Code, you can use Live Server plugin in order to launch the index into your preferred browser.
