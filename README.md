# Rule Of Thumb - Diego Pulido

### General

Welcome to my version of the **Rule of Thumb** website.
*This project was developed using Vanilla JS.*

Since the data.json file is consumed by a fetch request, the project needs to be served through either http or https, so the project should be deployed in a local server (if you are using VisualStudio Code, you can use Live Server plugin in order to launch the index.html locally into your preferred browser).
After consuming the data, it's content is stored into LocalStorage, in order interact with it through the voting system.

Whenever a user clicks on the *Vote Now* button after selecting an option, the local data is updated with the new vote entered. This data persists in the browser for as long as the user preserves the browser-saved variables.
